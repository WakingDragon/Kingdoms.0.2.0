Welcome to Kingdoms. This project is entirely open source. Feel free to use it and/or contribute to it.

## What is Kingdoms?

Kingdoms is a classic 2-player strategy board game. Once the Rules.pdf document is completed you will be able to print it out and play it at home (analog style!)

## Copyright and protections

There is no real copyright on this project: it is in the commons. However, assets may be used that require licencing, particularly during development. In these instances, I will specify which assets they are, and you should not consider their inclusion as me 'distributing' them in any way. You will need to sort out your own rights to use them.

## Key documents
* Architecture.md contains the planned structure of the of code
* Rules.pdf (TBD) will contain the rules of the game and how to play it + printable cards and board so you can play it the non-digital way.

## Roadmap
1. Create Rules.pdf
2. Create Itch.io site for feedback and simple links
3. Core rules engine
